# Z-measures
Z-score measures for estimating the probability of bank insolvency.

The library was built based on "Nonstationary Z-score measures" in the European Journal of Operational Research (2017), by Davide Mare, Roberto Rossi and Fernando Moreira. The authors of the paper were my supervisors. Please see the following link for a copy of the paper:

With regards to z7_1 and z7_2 please review the .docx files for a step-by-step explanation of the code.

I hope the algorithms serve a worthy purpose.

Best,

Mattia Bradascio.
