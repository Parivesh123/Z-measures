# zmeasures
Z-score measures for estimating the probability of bank insolvency.

The measures, taken from "Nonstationary Z-score measures" in the European Journal of Operational Research (2017), by Davide Mare, Roberto Rossi and Fernando Moreira.
The measures are implemented in a neat package that allows the user to choose between several statistics. Hence, the package provides flexibility.
It is important that the data is in a NxP matrix format, where the 3rd column represents the Return on Assets for a bank, and the fourth column represents the Capital Adequancy Ratio (Equity/Assets). 

For more information, please see the specified journal.
